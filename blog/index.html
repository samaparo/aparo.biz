        a block from Rodeo Drive on large black furniture leased with Japanese
        venture capital. Now that I'm actually here, the Disneyland metaphor is
        proving impossible to shake. For that matter, Rodeo Drive comes
        frequently to mind, though the local equivalent feels more like 30 or 40
        Beverly Centers put end to end.

        Was it Laurie Anderson who said that VR would never look real until they
        learned how to put some dirt in it? Singapore's airport, the Changi
        Airtropolis, seemed to possess no more resolution than some early VPL
        world. There was no dirt whatsoever; no muss, no furred fractal edge to
        things. Outside, the organic, florid as ever in the tropics, had been
        gardened into brilliant green, and all-too-perfect examples of itself.

        towering above the Strait of China.
